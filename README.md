# py-hangman
It's Hangman in Python, running on the command-line! I wrote this as part of a uni worksheet and decided to upload it to GitHub because why not.
This version of Hangman pulls words and definitions from the internet.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `requests` PIP library
- An internet connection to get words and definitions
